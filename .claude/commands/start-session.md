# Start Session

You are starting a new delivery session. Follow the Harness Operating Protocol from CLAUDE.md.

## Steps

1. Read harness/PROGRESS.md and harness/FEATURES.json
2. Read spec/REQ.md if it exists
3. Determine today's goals (1-2 items)
4. Update harness/PROGRESS.md with:
   - Today Goal
   - Current Status
   - Next Actions (max 5)
5. If any blockers or unknowns, document them

## Output

Provide a brief summary:

- What was done last session
- What we'll focus on today
- Any blockers or decisions needed
